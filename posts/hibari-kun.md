Stop! Hibari-kun! is an old anime from 1983 that has a mix of funny and romantic moments. It's about Kousaku, a teenage boy who goes to live with his mom's friend's family after she passed away. But, when he gets there, he finds out that one of the four daughters, Hibari, is actually a boy who likes to dress up as a girl and has a crush on Kousaku. Kousaku is surprised at first, but he starts to like Hibari too and they become closer as the show goes on.  
  
This anime is a funny and romantic show with lots of jokes and sweet moments. The songs at the beginning and end are cute and match the show well, and there are 35 episodes that are all fun to watch. One episode that stands out is when Kousaku and Hibari switch bodies and it leads to funny confusion and role changes.

In the show, Hibari tries to win Kousaku's heart, and they share some romantic moments together. But it's important to know that this anime is not about a romantic relationship between two boys (BL).  
  
To sum it up, Stop! Hibari-kun! is a funny and charming romantic comedy that will make you happy. If you like this type of show or just want to watch something that will make you feel good, you should give this anime a try, even though it's not very popular. You won't regret it.
