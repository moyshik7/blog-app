[MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1195/Zero_no_Tsukaima)  
Louise FranÃ§oise Le Blanc de La ValliÃ¨re is a self-absorbed mage in a world of wands, cloaks, and royalty. When her summoning ritual results in a catastrophic explosion, a boy named Saito Hiraga appears. Now Louise's familiar, Saito is treated as a slave, forced to clean her clothes and eat off the ground. Zero no Tsukaima follows Saito as he comes to terms with his new life and as Louise proves that there is more to her than her nickname suggests.  
  
Obnoxious female lead, comedy, magic and a sweet slow developing romance, you probably gonna love this one.

A tale of fantasy, adventure, and politics, Log Horizon explores the elements of gaming through the eyes of a master strategist who attempts to make the best of a puzzling situation.  
  
Smart MC, Loli Female Lead, Magic and so on. You are 100% gonna love this one, at least season 1 and 2.

## 07. Overlord 
[MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/29803/Overlord)  
YGGDRASIL was a Full-Dive Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game or DMMORPG. Within the game exists a guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, once consisting of 41 members and credited as one of the strongest guilds in the game. After an intense twelve-year run, the game servers are about to be shut down. Momonga finds that the game hasn't vanished, instead, it appears as if Nazarick has been transported to another reality altogether and, moreover, the non-player characters appear to have developed personalities of their own!  
  
I just love this one. Overpowered MC, magic, badass female lead and moreover, MC's love for his guild members just makes him more cool.

## 06. The Rising of the Shield Hero 
[MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35790/Tate_no_Yuusha_no_Nariagari)  
Naofumi Iwatani, an otaku, becomes cursed with the fate of being the "Shield Hero". Armed with only a measly shield, Naofumi is belittled and ridiculed by his fellow heroes and the kingdom's people due to his weak offensive capabilities and lackluster personality. He buys a demi-human slave on the verge of death named Raphtalia to accompany him on his travels.  
  
When the heroes are provided with resources and comrades to train with, Naofumi sets out with the only person willing to train alongside him, Malty Melormarc. He is soon betrayed by her, however, and becomes falsely accused of taking advantage of her, and is heavily discriminated against and hated by the people of Melromar for something he didn't do.  
  
Episode 1 enough to make you binge-watch the whole series without any break.

## 05. No Game No Life 
[MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/19815/No_Game_No_Life)  
Sora and Shiro are two shut-ins who dominate various online games under the username "Blank". After responding to an unknown user, they are suddenly transported to Disboard. Sixteen sentient races inhabit Disboard, a world overseen by Tet, the One True God. The lowest of the sixteenâ€”Imanityâ€”consists of humans, a race with no affinity for magic.  
  
They are taken to Elkia, where they meet Stephanie Dola, an emotional girl vying for the kingdom's sovereignty. Inspired by her passion, the duo decide to aid her in getting Elkia back on its feet. They ultimately aim to become the new rulers of the enigmatic realm.

## 04. KonoSuba: God's Blessing on this Wonderful World! 
[MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30831/Kono_Subarashii_Sekai_ni_Shukufuku_wo)  
After dying a laughable and pathetic death on his way back from buying a game, Kazuma Satou finds himself sitting before a beautiful but obnoxious goddess named Aqua. She provides the NEET with two options: continue on to heaven or reincarnate in every gamer's dream. Living in such a world is far different from how it plays out in a video game.  
  
Kazuma can choose one item of any kind to aid him in his quest, and the future hero selects Aqua. But Kazuma has made a grave mistakeâ€”Aqua is completely useless! Living in such a world is far different from how it plays out in a game. Instead of going on a thrilling adventure, the duo must first work to pay for their living expenses.  
  
Konosuba has beautiful art, unique characters, comedy (really a lot), useless Aqua, loli Megumin, pervert Darkness, and it's perfect for light-hearted Isekai lover.

## 03. That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime 
[MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37430/Tensei_shitara_Slime_Datta_Ken)  
The story follows Satoru Mikami as he is reincarnated as a goop of slime in an unfamiliar realm. In doing so, he acquires newfound skills and the power to devour anything and mimic its appearance and abilities. He stumbles upon Veldora, a powerful 'Storm Dragon', who has been sealed for the last 300 years. Feeling sorry for him, Satoru befriends the dragon, promising to help him. They decide to exchange names, Veldora bestows upon him the name Rimuru and receives the name Tempest in return. Rimuru Tempest is liberated from his past life and embarks on a fresh journey with a distinct goal in mind.  
  
I absolutely love TenSura (aka That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime). Our Rimuru is God level OP. She is cute (Genderless Slime, but...), powerful, has a great personality and the story is 10/10, just amazing.

## 02. Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World <div id="2"></div>
[MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu)  
When Subaru Natsuki leaves the convenience store, the last thing he expects is to be wrenched from his everyday life and dropped into a fantasy world. Not long after his arrival, he is attacked by some thugs. Fortunately, a mysterious beauty named Satella, in hot pursuit after the one who stole her insignia, saves him.  
  
But unbeknownst to them, a much darker force stalks the pair from the shadows, and just minutes after locating the insignia, they are brutally murdered. However, Subaru reawakens to a familiar scene, only to be confronted by the same group of thugs, and the enigma deepens as history inexplicably repeats itself.  
  
Beautiful art, soundtrack, character design, it's 10/10 Anime for me. Do you like dark fantasy? Something unique and detailed? If yes, this show is perfect for you!

## 01. Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation 
[MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/39535/Mushoku_Tensei__Isekai_Ittara_Honki_Dasu)  
A 34-year-old shut-in awakens in another world as a baby born to two loving parents. With the mind of a grown adult, he starts to display magical talent that exceeds all expectations. He tries to make the most of his new opportunity while conquering his traumatic past. And perhaps, one day, he may find the one thing he could not find in his old world -- love. 
  
We are at #1. Mushoku Tensei goes over all of my expectation. Amazing art work, detailed, story line, opening, ending, each new episode, each second, It is just beautiful. You won't be just watching it on your screen, you can feel the world, the art and the music that will make you fall asleep. Mushoku Tensei speed-run the series without losing a single details. You will feel each second so much valuable than a whole episode in some other Anime, It's that good.
