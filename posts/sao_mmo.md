### The Isekai Experience We Dream Of
People who like isekai anime want to escape to a beautiful world with magic. They like the thrill and feeling of freedom and accomplishment that comes with it. Isekai anime usually falls into two categories: one where the character dies and is reincarnated in another world, and one where the character is sucked into a game. The second option might not be real life teleportation, but it offers an alternate world that you can escape to in your hands. Games like SAO, Log Horizon, Overlord, and Btoom! are all about MMORPGs (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game), which can give you that isekai experience. However, there are many games online that claim to be like isekai, but most of them don't focus on the most important part of the experience, which is player-to-player interaction and community development.

### Why community is important
Let's be honest, a game world doesn't feel real unless there are other people in it who can interact with you like real humans. Games like Witcher 3 and GTA V have lots of characters in their worlds, but they are just computer-controlled characters that can't create a unique and special experience for you. If you want to have a unique story in a game, it's important that other real people control the game's ecosystem and economy. The two best games that I've found on the internet that are available on both mobile and PC are the ones that I've played for over two years each. I'll tell you about these games and what features they have, along with my personal experience playing them.

## 2. Toram Online
![](https://images2.imgbox.com/36/fd/9NYVzVWB_o.jpg)  
Toram Online is a game that was made by ASOBIMO in 2015. ASOBIMO is a company that is known for making many popular Japanese massive multiplayer online games. Toram is considered one of their best games, not because of its graphics, which are outdated since the game was made in 2015, but because of its amazing community. The game gives players a lot of freedom and has a strong storyline. Every few months, the developers release updates that expand the story and make it feel like you're reading a manga or watching an anime. The game has a big world with beautiful places to explore. It's like a classic RPG with magic and fantasy elements.  
  
**Some of the main features of the Toram are :**  
- Complete Freedom
- More than 500 billion combinations available! (outfits included)
- Skill Combination: Toram does not restrict you to a particular weapon or class all skills are available for the taking, so you can customize your character the way you want!
- Fully adjustable weapon appearances
- Guild and House features
- Over-the-top excellent combat system: you will feel like a true badass as your character gets stronger and you can't do that by leveling alone. The game is very less level-dependent; being higher level only means having more skill points at stack. With the right equipment and skill set and not to mention the actual real-life gaming skills, a level 150 can easily take out a level 200 in combat damage performance.
  

The thing about toram is that it is not just a game to fight but a game to make friends and hang out. In the main cities of the game like Sofia City, you can see a bunch of random people just hanging out, dancing, chatting, pulling jokes, and having fun. There are guilds where you can often see members hanging out in guildbars and relaxing around. Toram has a great and friendly community and it is very easy to make friends. If you are into anime and Isekai fantasy the game is full of SAO-motivated players so you will make friends in no time which are guaranteed to give you the time of your life!  
  
## 1. LifeAfter

LifeAfter is a game that was made by NetEase Games and was released on December 17, 2018. It has been downloaded over 10 million times on the Play Store. Compared to the game Toram, it is newer and has better graphics, which make it look like a game you would play on a computer. The game has a large map that is completely open and is almost as big as the map in the game GTA V. However, because the graphics are so good, it requires a lot of power to run the game at maximum settings, even on phones that are designed for gaming, like the ROG. Sometimes, when there are a lot of players in one area, the game might slow down and lag. The game takes place in a world that has been taken over by zombies. The developers of the game are very active and are always making improvements to the game to make it better. They also work hard to design the environment in a way that players can work together and the world feels more real. LifeAfter can be played on different types of devices, including computers and mobiles.  
**Some of the main features of the game are:**  

- A vast open world: more than 30 different map areas featuring all kinds of terrains. Desert, Volcanic region, Islands, beaches, Plains, Marshlands, Sea, Cities, Farmlands, and many more!
- Different Jobs or Certs as they call them in game: Rifleman, Sniper, Virus Expert, Upholster, Armorer, Gunmakerm, Treasure-Hunter, Logger, Miner, and Hemp-Picker.
- Various missions and other events to keep you occupied: Area operations, Mystic Creatures, Assistant Quests, Map Exploration, and much more, there is always gonna be something to do!
- Camp and Housings: Each player has their own house provided with a lot of customizable options, there is also the option of cohabitation in case you want to share the Home with someone and live together!
- Revenants, Half Human Half Infected: Get the power of zombies in the body of a human
- Death High: Did you always dream of something like Aincrad, well this is a small competitive image of it, except this one, got zombies in it?
  

LifeAfter is a game that has many different features beyond what we've talked about. The game is mainly focused on working together with other players, but it also has a part where you compete with them based on levels. Even if there is just a small difference in levels, it can make a big impact. To help lower-level players, the game gives them extra experience points, and every few months, a new server is launched where everyone starts from level one. LifeAfter is very realistic and makes you feel like you are really there. But to enjoy the game fully, it's best to have a computer or phone with good capabilities. If you have a lower-end phone, you might want to consider playing Toram instead.
